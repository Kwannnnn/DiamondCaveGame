___

For the sake of transparency and to make certain that all parties involved are aware and in agreement of what is to be delivered, here is the full list of deliverables for Sprint 1:

* 1 map with set spawn and exit locations (where a player spawns when entering and where he must go to move to the next map).
* Sprites for the players, map tiles, collectible diamonds and obstacles that would appear on the map.
* Themes for the different worlds must be selected and simple designs must have been created.
* A set of perks must be outlined that will either be granted to the player after completing a map or world.
* 2 players must be able to connect and play on the same map in a co-op fashion.

Glossary of terms:

* Map – The map on which the player will play the game. There will be many different maps in the finished product, most with slightly different art styles and objectives for the players.
* World – A collection of 5 or so different maps. Each world will have a separate theme. This theme will influence the design of the maps it contains. This design influence might be as subtle as a slight change in the colour tone of the maps. Worlds can effectively be thought of as checkpoints where at the end of each world there will be a noticeable change in the game to the player.
* Sprite – A visual design or mock-up for the different objects in the game like the obstacles or grid parts of a map.
* Diamond – An object in the game used for the purpose of collection. The gameplay will mostly revolve around collecting these diamonds to progress to further maps and thus advancing through the game.
* Perks - Bonuses that you get after completing one map. A player has a choice to pick one of perks, which improves certain characteristics or adds some extra skill to the hero.
