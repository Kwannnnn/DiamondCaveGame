For the sake of transparency and to make sure that all parties involved are aware and in agreement with what is to be delivered, here is the complete list of deliverables for Sprint 1:

* 1 map with set spawn and exit locations (where a player spawns when entering and where he must go to move to the following map).
* Sprites for the players, map tiles, collectible diamonds, and obstacles that would appear on the map.
* Themes for the different worlds must be selected, and simple designs must have been created.
* A set of perks must be outlined that will be granted to the player after completing a map or world.
* 2 players must be able to connect and play on the same map in a co-op fashion.

Glossary of terms:

* Map – The map on which the player will play the game. There will be many different maps in the finished product, most with slightly different art styles and objectives.
* World – A collection of 5 or so different maps. Each world will have a different theme. This theme will influence the design of the maps it contains. This design influence might be as subtle as a slight change in the color tone of the maps. Worlds can effectively be thought of as checkpoints where there will be a noticeable change in the game at the end of each world.
* Sprite – A visual design or mock-up for the different objects in the game like the obstacles or grid parts of a map.
* Diamond – An object in the game used for collection. The gameplay will mainly revolve around collecting these diamonds to progress to other maps and thus advancing through the game.
* Perks - Bonuses that you get after completing one map. A player chooses to pick one of the perks, improving specific characteristics or adding an extra skill to the character.
