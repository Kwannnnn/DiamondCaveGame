## Glossary of terms

* Map – The map on which the player will play the game. There will be many different maps in the finished product, most with slightly different art styles and objectives for the players.

* World – A collection of 5 or so different maps. Each world will have a distinct theme that will influence the design of the maps it contains. This design influence might be as subtle as a slight change in the maps' color tone. Worlds can effectively be thought of as checkpoints, where at the end of each world, there will be a noticeable change in the game for the player.

* Sprite – A visual design or mock-up for the different objects in the game, like the obstacles or grid parts of a map.

* Diamond – An object in the game used for collection. The gameplay will mainly revolve around collecting these diamonds to progress to further maps and thus advancing through the game.

* Perks - Bonuses that you get after completing one map. A player chooses to pick one of the perks, which improves specific characteristics or adds some extra skill to the hero.
