# Sprint retrospective

## Sprint 1

### What went well

- Team composition worked without any need for changes
- Everyone was active in standup meetings
- GIT organization worked in our favor
- Team members helping each other

### What slowed us down

- Standup meetings tend to drag on sometimes
- Identifying the purpose of code classes is difficult
- Vague backlog definitions caused the final product to deviate from the envision result
- A lack of a unified code style

### What can be improved

- Add more code comments
- Reduce the length of standup meetings by scheduling support jobs for after the meeting
- Backlog descriptions should be made more specifically
- Agree on a team-wide linting style

## Sprint 2

### What went well

- Stand-up meeting times improved from last sprint, helping jobs were left for
after the stand-up.
- Backlog items descriptions were clearer compared to last sprint
- More comments were added to the complex parts of the code base, making it
better understandable and maintainable for everyone.
- Git organization improved, labels were added for better organization of the
scrum board
- Backlog revision has started, seems to work well for now

### What slowed us down

- A few people got sick, which caused some delay in completing backlogs
- Communication did not go very well: Important messages in the official
channel for communication did not get enough attention, ..
- Some people that could not attend a meeting they did not notify.
- Time tracking needs to be updated consistently
- Generating backlog tasks when picking a user story, instead of creating
all backlogs in the beginning of the sprint, caused unnecessary planning
meetings
- Conventions about git branches, commit messages, were not followed by
some individuals
- Code linting expectation from previous Sprint didn't go through

### Plan for improvement

- Create a linting configuration and integrate it in our CI/CD.
- Be stricter with regard to meetings: set up a steady meeting days, with
clear time blocks for each meeting topic, and enforce code of conduct for
individuals that do not show up to a meeting.
- Generate all backlogs in the beginning of the sprint
- Contact the publisher more often regarding updates, e.g. sick people, product
status, etc.

## Sprint 3

### What went well

- The review system helped everyone understand the project more and helped prevent many issues from being merged.
- Teamwork was improved. There was always someone ready to help out.
- We frequently assigned bug-fixing issues. This meant bugs were resolved quickly and not left for a long time.
- Overall communication improved. Important issues were discussed in collectively in person.
- We managed to finalize almost all major functionality. This made playing and testing enjoyable.
- There were always tasks to assign, and they were uploaded to GitLab faster.
- Morale improved across the whole team.

### What slowed us down

- Documentation was often out-of-date.
- Some members had trouble using git effectively. We need to create more tutorials for this.
- Laser trap implementation took too long and delayed other tasks. The task should've been reassigned.
- People often didn't ask for help or asked when it was too late.
- Issues weren't defined clearly enough. Definition of done was often unclear.
- Team meetings were not well organized and all over the place
- Merge requests took a long time to be reviewed and approved.
- Communication between the sub-teams was lacking sometimes.
- Tasks were often too dependent on one another

### What can be improved

- Stand-up times decreased from last sprint but this can still be improved
