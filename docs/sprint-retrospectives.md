# Sprint retrospective

## Sprint 1

### What went well

- Team composition worked without any need for changes
- Everyone was active in standup meetings
- GIT organization worked in our favor
- Team members helping each other

### What slowed us down

- Standup meetings tend to drag on sometimes
- Identifying the purpose of code classes is difficult
- Vague backlog definitions caused the final product to deviate from the envision result
- A lack of a unified code style

### What can be improved

- Add more code comments
- Reduce the length of standup meetings by scheduling support jobs for after the meeting
- Backlog descriptions should be made more specifically
- Agree on a team-wide linting style
