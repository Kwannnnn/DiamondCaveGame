# Sprint retrospective

## Sprint 1

### What went well

- Team composition worked without any need for changes
- Everyone was active in standup meetings
- GIT organization worked in our favor
- Team members helping each other

### What slowed us down

- Standup meetings tend to drag on sometimes
- Identifying the purpose of code classes is difficult
- Vague backlog definitions caused the final product to deviate from the envision result
- A lack of a unified code style

### What can be improved

- Add more code comments
- Reduce the length of standup meetings by scheduling support jobs for after the meeting
- Backlog descriptions should be made more specifically
- Agree on a team-wide linting style


## Sprint 2

### What went well

- Stand-up meeting times improved from last sprint, helping jobs were left for
after the stand-up.
- Backlog items descriptions were clearer compared to last sprint
- More comments were added to the complex parts of the code base, making it
better understandable and maintainable for everyone.
- Git organization improved, labels were added for better organization of the
scrum board
- Backlog revision has started, seems to work well for now

### What slowed us down

- A few people got sick, which caused some delay in completing backlogs
- Communication did not go very well: Important messages in the official
channel for communication did not get enough attention, ..
- Some people that could not attend a meeting they did not notify.
- Time tracking needs to be updated consistently
- Generating backlog tasks when picking a user story, instead of creating
all backlogs in the beginning of the sprint, caused unnecessary planning
meetings
- Conventions about git branches, commit messages, were not followed by
some individuals
- Code linting expectation from previous Sprint didn't go through

### Plan for improvement

- Create a linting configuration and integrate it in our CI/CD.
- Be stricter with regard to meetings: set up a steady meeting days, with
clear time blocks for each meeting topic, and enforce code of conduct for
individuals that do not show up to a meeting.
- Generate all backlogs in the beginning of the sprint
- Contact the publisher more often regarding updates, e.g. sick people, product
status, etc.
