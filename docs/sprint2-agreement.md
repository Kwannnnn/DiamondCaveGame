Glossary of terms:

Map – The map on which the player will play the game. There will be many different maps in the finished
product, most with slightly different art styles and objectives for the players.

World – A collection of 5 or so different maps. Each world will have a separate theme. This theme will
influence the design of the maps it contains. This design influence might be as subtle as a slight change in
the colour tone of the maps. Worlds can effectively be thought of as checkpoints where at the end of each
world there will be a noticeable change in the game to the player.

Sprite – A visual design or mock-up for the different objects in the game like the obstacles or grid parts of a
map.

Diamond – An object in the game used for the purpose of collection. The gameplay will mostly revolve
around collecting these diamonds to progress to further maps and thus advancing through the game.

Perks - Bonuses that you get after completing one map. A player has a choice to pick one of perks, which
improves certain characteristics or adds some extra skill to the hero.
