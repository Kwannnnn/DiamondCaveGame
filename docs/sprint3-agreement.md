Glossary of terms:

* Map – The map on which the player will play the game. There will be many different maps in the finished product, most with slightly different art styles and objectives.
* World – A collection of 5 or so different maps. Each world will have a different theme. This theme will influence the design of the maps it contains. This design influence might be as subtle as a slight change in the color tone of the maps. Worlds can effectively be thought of as checkpoints where there will be a noticeable change in the game at the end of each world.
* Sprite – A visual design or mock-up for the different objects in the game like the obstacles or grid parts of a map.
* Diamond – An object in the game used for collection. The gameplay will mainly revolve around collecting these diamonds to progress to other maps and thus advancing through the game.
* Perks - Bonuses that you get after completing one map. A player chooses to pick one of the perks, improving specific characteristics or adding an extra skill to the character.
